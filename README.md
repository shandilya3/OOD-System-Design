# OOD-System-Design
A place to reinforce the understanding of important Design Principles for self learning

# SOLID
 1. Single Responsibility Principle,  a class or method should do only one thing so that it could be resued at other places.
 2. Open Close Principle, we should be able to extned a class but not modify it.
 3. Liskov Substituion Principle , object in a class should be replaceble by the instance of it's subclasses without altering     the working of the program.
 4. Interface Segragation Principle,  make your interface generic, you shouldn't enforce clients to implements methods which       client  doesn't need.
 5.Dependecy Inversion , high level modules shouldn't depend on low level module.
